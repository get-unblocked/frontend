# Try Unblocked Frontend

Our frontend is composed of a Wordpress CMS for marking and a Deno Fresh web app that we are using to demostrate the power of Unblocked. Previously, we used Unblocked itself to demo, but that is a little to meta for many and we want to have a way to demostrate Unblocked solving some specific problems for specific cases of developers.


### Tech

We use WordPress for our blog and marketing.
We use Deno fresh for our frontend that that talks to our backend 
using microservices.
We use Auth0 to authenticate users.
We use firebase for notifications.
We use postgres for our database.
