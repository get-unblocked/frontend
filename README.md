# Try Unblocked Frontend

Our frontend is composed of a Wordpress CMS for marking and a Deno Fresh web app that we are using to demostrate the power of Unblocked. Previously, we used Unblocked itself to demo, but that is a little to meta for many and we want to have a way to demostrate Unblocked solving some specific problems for specific cases of developers.

### Usage
