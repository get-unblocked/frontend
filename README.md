# Try Unblocked Frontend

This is an amazing Deno Fresh web app that we are using to demostrate the power of Unblocked. Previously, we used Unblocked itself to demo, but that is a little to meta for many and we want to have a way to demostrate Unblocked solving some specific problems for specific cases of developers.

### Usage
```
